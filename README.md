# NFT-Analysis

Using Kaggle Dataset, I went through the data for analysis and insights, proposing my own questions to be answered by the data
Data was obtained from “Ethereum NFTs” on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simiotic/ethereum-nfts
It includes all data of Ethereum NFT transactions between April 1, 2021 to September 25, 2021. 
Over 4.5 million transactions. 

This is a very large dataset - 7.5 GB .

The main tables are mints and transfers - the other tables are derived from or auxiliary to these.

This project was completed to help Syntegrate better understand the NFT market.
